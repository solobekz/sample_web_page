# sample_web_page

This is a webpage designed using html/css and some javascript, bootstrap tool was used to help simplify some functions. 
I utilized the HTML_CSS.zip file provided by the seedstar recruitment team as design reference for the web page.

The webpage was made responsive using bootstrap and css.

Assumptions: 
1. The webpage is the latest transaction page for a bank's web app
2. On the latest transactions section, I assumed that all credit transactions were displayed with a dark background compared to debit transactions.
3. The section that displays Account Balance is a carousel that displays more opportunities provide by the bank when slid to the right.
